# 1 Introduction

This lab report tests the coverage ranges of our previous lab report using EclEmma. The coverage tool allowed us to enhance our unit tests to gain better control flow coverage (for branch, condition, and statement). In addition, this lab covers two data flow graphs to show the data flow coverage of the calculateColumnTotal and getLength methods.

Our goal in this lab included creating more enhanced unit test cases to incerase covergae and create data flow graphs to identify def-use pairs.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)
